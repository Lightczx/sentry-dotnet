This sample is a minimal ASP.NET Core 2.1 app that uses Sentry.
It can be used for occasional sanity checking for potentially breaking changes.

Since .NET Core 2.1 is no longer supported by Microsoft, it is recommended you
use a newer version of ASP.NET Core in your own applications.

Refer to the other samples for a more complete demonstration of Sentry's features.
